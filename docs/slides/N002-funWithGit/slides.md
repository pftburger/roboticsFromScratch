This will be quite a short course. So attendance will be a little stricter than normal. Please let me know in advance if you cannot make a lesson so that we can work something out.

Each week we will make a functional robot. Starting with something quite simple on week 1, hopefully escalating to something *amazing* in week 4.

We will use git to submit our work. Git is a (distributed) version tracking and control system.
To make life simple, we will just use github.
Please sign up and familiarise yourself with it. In the first class we will do this together. If you missed the first class I will upload a tutorial shortly.

You will also be requited to document the physical robot (each week), with :
+ High quality photos shot on the schools DSLR
+ A short video, at minimum in full HD, with good lighting etc. Do not re-encode them, just deliver the raw video. We will make a comp at the end of the seminar.
Where to upload these to follow shortly
+ Any supplemental material like circuit diagrams or flow charts you may think are relevant
